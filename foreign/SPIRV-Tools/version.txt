    Fix constant propagation of induction variables.
    
    This fixes https://github.com/KhronosGroup/SPIRV-Tools/issues/1143.
    When an instruction transitions from constant to bottom (varying) in the
    lattice, we were telling the propagator that the instruction was
    varying, but never updating the actual value in the values table.
    
    This led to incorrect value substitutions at the end of propagation.
    
    The patch also re-enables CCP in -O and -Os.
